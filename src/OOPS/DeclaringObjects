Object Creation: new instantiates a new object of a class.

Memory Allocation: Allocates memory for the object in the heap.

Constructor Invocation: Calls the class constructor to initialize the object.

Reference Return: Returns a reference to the created object.

Array Creation: Also used for creating arrays, like int[] arr = new int[5];

Dynamic Allocation: Unlike static allocation, new allows for dynamic memory
                       allocation, allocating memory at runtime.
