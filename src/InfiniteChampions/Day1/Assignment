1. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
• Problem: You are given a number of spherical balloons spread in a 2D space.
For each balloon, the input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter.
Find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
An arrow can be shot vertically from different points along the x-axis.
• Objective: Implement a function that returns the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons.

2. Sliding Window Maximum
• Problem: You are given an integer array nums. There is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right.
You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
Return the maximum sliding window.
• Objective: Implement a function that returns an array of maximum values for each window position.

3. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
• Problem: Given a sorted array of integers arr and a target value, find the start and end positions of the target value. If the target does not exist in the array, return [-1, -1].
• Objective: Implement a function that returns the indices of the first and last occurrences of the target value.
